# The Syncentropy Law™  
> The Official IP Beacon for the Work of **Jasmine Chiu**

---

This repository serves as the **canonical source and intellectual-property (IP) beacon** for  
**The Syncentropy Law™** — a new framework for understanding intelligence, computation, and complex systems.

The theory posits that the bottleneck of modern AI is **not computation and scale, but synchronization**.

## The Core Framework

The Syncentropy Law provides the first engineering blueprint for achieving *coherence* in AI.  
It is built on two core components first defined in the foundational paper:

1. **Syncentropy™ (S)** —  
   A measurable engineering metric designed to quantify the degree of *chaos* versus *coherence*  
   in any distributed system, from GPU clusters to neural networks.  
   *(This is the official brand name for “Synchronization Entropy.”)*

2. **The S-Decay Principle™** —  
   The core axiom of the Law, mathematically expressed as  
   \[
   \frac{dS}{dt} \le 0
   \]  
   which demonstrates that any adaptive system will spontaneously “decay” toward a state of lower Syncentropy.  
   This is the **Law of Stability.**
