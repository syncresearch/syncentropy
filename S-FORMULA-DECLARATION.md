# The S-Formula (Synchronization Entropy Theory)

**First proposed by Jasmine Chiu, October 2025**

This repository records the original disclosure of the S-Formula  
— a unified model linking synchronization (S) and dynamic field (F).  
The theory states that all self-organizing systems evolve naturally toward lower synchronization entropy (dS/dt ≤ 0),  
while maintaining dynamic stability through F near S ≈ 0.
