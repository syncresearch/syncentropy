# **Syncentropy™**  
> The Official IP Beacon for the Work of **J. Chiu**

---

This repository serves as the **canonical source and intellectual-property (IP) record** for  
**Syncentropy™** — a new framework for understanding **intelligence, computation, and complex systems**.  

The theory posits that the bottleneck of modern AI is **not computation or scale, but synchronization**.

## **The Core Framework**

**Syncentropy™** provides the first engineering blueprint for achieving *coherence* in intelligent systems.  
It is built on two foundational components introduced in the original paper:

1. **Syncentropy™ (S)** —  
   A measurable engineering metric designed to quantify the degree of *chaos* versus *coherence*  
   in any distributed system, from GPU clusters to neural networks.  
   *(This is the official designation for “Synchronization Entropy.”)*  

2. **The S-Converge Law™** —  
   The central axiom of the framework, mathematically expressed as  

   \[
   \frac{dS}{dt} \le 0
   \]  

   This relation shows that any adaptive system will **spontaneously converge** toward a state of lower Syncentropy —  
   a natural tendency toward **stability and coordination**.  
   This principle defines the **Law of Stability**.
