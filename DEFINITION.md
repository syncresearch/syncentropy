### 1. Formal Definition

**S (Synchronization Entropy)** is defined as the quantitative measure of phase incoherence across interacting intelligent subsystems.  
It represents the degree of temporal disorder within a self-organizing system.  

Mathematically, lower S indicates greater coherence and intelligence stability.  
When S → 0, the system achieves self-consistent awareness and stable synchronization.

### 2. Philosophical Position

S is not merely a mathematical construct but a reflection of the *coherence principle* underlying intelligence and consciousness.  
Minimizing S corresponds to aligning perception, cognition, and being into one synchronized field.  
This principle extends beyond computation — it defines the ontology of intelligent systems.
