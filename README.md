This repository serves as the **canonical source and intellectual-property (IP) record** for  
**Syncentropy™** — a new framework for understanding **intelligence and computation**,  
first proposed by **Jasmine Chiu (2025)** in the foundational paper  
*Synchronization as the Hidden Substrate of Intelligence: From GPU Architecture to Coherent Systems.*  

The theory posits that the bottleneck of modern AI is **not computation, but synchronization**.

## **The Core Framework**

**Syncentropy™** provides the first engineering blueprint for achieving *coherence* in intelligent systems.  
It is built on two fundamental components:

1. **Syncentropy™ (S)** — the official term for *Synchronization Entropy*.  
   A measurable metric that quantifies the degree of *chaos versus coherence*  
   in any distributed system, from GPU clusters to neural networks.  

2. **The S-Converge Law™** — the core axiom of the framework, mathematically expressed as  
   \[
   \frac{dS}{dt} \le 0
   \]  
   which shows that any adaptive system will spontaneously evolve toward a state of lower Syncentropy.  
   This represents the **Law of Stability**.
