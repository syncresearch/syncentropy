## The Official IP Beacon  
© 2025 Jasmine Chiu. All rights reserved.  

This repository serves as the **canonical source and intellectual-property (IP) beacon** for  
**The Syncentropy Law™** — a new framework for understanding intelligence and computation first proposed by  
**Jasmine Chiu (2025)** in the foundational paper *The SyncEntropy Hypothesis*.  

The theory posits that the bottleneck of modern AI is **not computation, but synchronization**.

## The Core Framework  

The Syncentropy Law provides the first engineering blueprint for achieving *coherence* in AI.  
It is built on two core components:  

1. **Syncentropy™ (S)** — the official term for “Synchronization Entropy.”   
 A new, measurable metric quantifying the degree of *chaos vs. coherence* in any distributed system, from GPU clusters to neural networks.  

2. **The S-Decay Principle™** — the core axiom of the Law, mathematically expressed as   
 \[
 \frac{dS}{dt} \le 0
 \]  
 which shows that any adaptive system will spontaneously evolve toward a state of lower Syncentropy.  
 This is the **Law of Stability.**
