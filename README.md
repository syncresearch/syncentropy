## Statement of Origin
This repository establishes the original record of the **SyncEntropy Hypothesis**,  
a framework proposed by **Jasmine Chiu** (2025) defining *system intelligence as coordination entropy (S)*.

It bridges information theory, collective intelligence, and dynamic equilibrium—  
proposing that **synchronization patterns, not prediction accuracy,** define the emergent intelligence of markets, algorithms, and agents.

The repository serves as a **public timestamp** to document authorship and concept origin.

## Abstract
The SyncEntropy Hypothesis introduces an S-value to quantify the internal coherence of complex adaptive systems.  
When applied to financial systems, S provides a diagnostic rather than predictive tool — revealing when a portfolio, model, or market  
enters over-synchronization or loss-of-coherence states.  
This principle generalizes to AI learning dynamics, organizational intelligence, and collective cognition.

> **Core Claim:**  
> “Intelligence is the minimization of internal coordination entropy.”

## Scope and Future Work
- Empirical validation via synthetic data and real-market backtests  
- Cross-domain generalization: AI, ecology, human networks  
- Mathematical formalization of S as a dynamic thermodynamic quantity  
- Development of open metrics & visualization dashboards
